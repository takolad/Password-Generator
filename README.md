# Password_Generator

## Description
    This is a **JavaScript** powered Password Generator. It prompts the users for *length* they  
    would prefer for their password (**1-128 characters**). Then it confirms which of 4 *types*  
    (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special) of characters it would like included (minimum  
    of 1 type selected) in the password generated. After generating a password the JS will write  
    the password into the webpage.
